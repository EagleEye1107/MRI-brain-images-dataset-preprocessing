# MRI-brain-images-dataset-preprocessing
The aim of this project, is to know how to improve the quality of MRI brain images by preprocessing them and prepare the dataset for Machine Learning &amp; Data Mining process.

# Preprocessing steps :
### 1. Standardize images by resizing them
### 2. Image equalization
### 3. Brain Tissue segmentation
### 4. Splitting dataset (trainset - testset)
